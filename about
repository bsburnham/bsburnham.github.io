			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Previously, I received a B.A. in Geosciences and Arts & Technology from the University of Texas at Dallas 
			where I was working with both digital artists and geologists to develop methods to analyse and visualise 
			photorealistic models of outcrop data. </p>
			
			<p>Upon graduating with my Masters, I decided I wanted to explore more of what 3D geologic modelling had 
			to offer the geosciences, and ultimately lead me to pursue and complete a PhD at Manchester. The PhD took 
			me all over the world from South America to Spain and back again. This ultimately led to a fortuitous 
			trip to California that opened my eyes to the world of sandstone intrusions, and my current position 
			as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Sand Injetion Research Group at the University of Aberdeen.  
			My time during the PhD and currently as a Research Fellow has only further strengthened my desire to 
			continue to find unique solutions to scientific and geologic questions. </p>

			<p>Furthemore, the collaborations with artists and scientists that Iâ€™ve been involved with were
			scientifically interesting, artistically innovating and wholly fulfilling. It is my belief that 
			adequate and effective dissemination of scientific information is fundamentally linked with artistic 
			expression of interpretation and representation of facts and new discoveries. Because of this I will 
			continue to pursue these ventures and welcome any projects that come along.. get in touch! </p>
