			<h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
			<p>3D geologic modelling, lidar â€“ terrestrial & airborne laser scanning, photogrammetry, 
        geospatial application, sedimentology, geomorphology, sequence stratigraphy, 3D sedimentary basin analysis, 
        reservoir modelling and characterisation</p>
			
        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <p>My Undergraduate and Masters research at the University of Texas at Dallas focused on developing techniques 
          to acquire, integrate and visualise high resolution geospatial data derived from satellite, lidar and 
          photogrammetry data to build photorealistic digital outcrop models and virtual environments. These models 
          were primarily used as teaching aids and training modules for academic coursework as well as industry training sessions.</p>

			  <p>My PhD from the University of Manchester research focused on investigating the reservoir characterisation potential 
          of a 3D geologic modelling approach to a medial-distal portion of distributive fluvial system. By using lidar and 
          photogrammetry to create geologic models of the architecture and object geometry within the system, I am able to 
          integrate field based measurements with the digital models to quantitatively map the facies and geostatistics.</p>
        
        <p>My postdoc and research fellowship position, within the Sand Injection Research Group at the University of Aberdeen, 
          focuses on analysing 3D digital outcrop models from lidar and photogrammetry to extract geostatistical information 
          of subseismic sandstone intrusions within a large sand injection complex. These data are used for production and 
          analysis of 3D forward seismic models and subsequent analysis to quantify uncertainty related with interpretation 
          analysis of subseismic-scale sandstone intrusion features. </p>
