Research Experience

My Undergraduate and Masters research at the University of Texas at Dallas focused on developing techniques to acquire, integrate and visualise high resolution geospatial data derived from satellite, lidar and photogrammetry data to build photorealistic digital outcrop models and virtual environments. These models were primarily used as teaching aids and training modules for academic coursework as well as industry training sessions.

My PhD from the University of Manchester research  focused on investigating the reservoir characterisation potential of a 3D geologic modelling approach to a medial-distal portion of distributive fluvial system. By using lidar and photogrammetry to create geologic models of the architecture and object geometry within the system, I am able to integrate field based measurements with the digital models to quantitatively map the facies and geostatistics.

My postdoc and research fellowship position, within the Sand Injection Research Group at the University of Aberdeen, focuses on analysing 3D digital outcrop models from lidar and photogrammetry to extract geostatistical information of subseismic sandstone intrusions within a large sand injection complex. These data are used for production and analysis of 3D forward seismic models and subsequent analysis to quantify uncertainty related with interpretation analysis of subseismic-scale sandstone intrusion features
