	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>My name is Brian, and I am currently a Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen, and a recent graduate of the 
	University of Manchester, with a Ph.D. in Basin Analysis and Petroleum Geoscience. Primarily, I work and collaborate 
	with earth scientists to quantitatively characterise and analyse 3D geometry and architecture of outcrops from around 
	the world. I am currently working on a funded project to characterise and analyse subseismic scale sandstone intrusion 
	features in a large (reservoir-scale) sand injectite complex, using the latest 3D digital outcrop modelling techniques.
	</p>
	<p>Alternatively, I collaborate with researchers in the arts and sciences, primarily with Roger Malina of the ArtSciLab 
	at the University of Texas at Dallas.
	</p>
	<p>Feel free to peruse my site to see tid bits of info about me and my research. If you’re feeling slightly more 
	adventurous, check out what’s happening on <a href="https://twitter.com/bsburnham">Twitter</a>. Either way, 
	feel free to check things out and say 'Hi'.
